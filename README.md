# UNM's Statistics 577 - Introduction to Bayesian Modeling
# Final Project

The primary aim of the analysis is to quantify the effect of beta-carotene treatment on
serum beta-carotene levels over time.


In addition, there are two secondary aims for the analysis. (1) Quantify whether the effect
of treatment on serum beta-carotene differs by age, gender, BMI, or cholesterol. (2) Quantify the
effect of treatment on serum vitamin E levels over time, and determine if serum vitamin E levels
are correlated with serum beta-carotene levels over time.

It was a group project, and my part of the project was to work on model building and model checking: "Discuss any statistical work you did to find and check
your final model. If you considered a range of possible models in your analysis, you should
explain how you picked the major models you reported on in the previous section. You
should also include discussion of Bayesian convergence metrics and a sensitivity analysis
examining the importance of your choice of prior for your final models."
